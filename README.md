# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Christopher Vu

### Currently a graduate student in Scientific Computing & Applied Mathematics at UCSC. I enjoy using data to uncover insights, make predictions, and clearly communicate results through visualizations, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling. I work with tools like Python, R, SQL, MATLAB, and Fortran to solve real-world problems and share meaningful findings.
